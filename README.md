## Lessons Learned

This bootcamp offers comprehensive lessons in web development, focusing primarily on front-end technologies, with an emphasis on JavaScript and APIs. It covers how to use APIs to retrieve data from external websites and visualize it in charts for effective data analysis. This approach is highly beneficial as it automates data retrieval, eliminating the need for manual collection and making data reading and analysis more efficient. One of the standout features of the project is its ability to update data daily.

While certain aspects of the lessons may be challenging for beginners, the bootcamp introduced me to new concepts and methods that expanded my knowledge. Despite the simplicity of the final website, the project was a rewarding challenge.
